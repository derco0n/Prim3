# Prim3
This is is simple programm that finds prime numbers.
It is written in C++ and uses class-inheritance and multithreading.
As I'm learning C++ myself at the moment, this programm will most likely not be the cleanest or most powerful approach.
However, this software is intended for educational purposes and may teach you something on your path learning programming.

Have fun.
